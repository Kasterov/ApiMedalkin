API MEDALKIN

This bot was created using the C# programming language. When you add it to the chat, you will be able to issue "medals" to all users of the chat. What's the point? When some event occurs and one of the users wants to jokingly capture it in the chat memory, then when a special command is written, a smiley face will be saved in the database for a specific user, a description of the event for which this smiley/medal was issued and date. Emoticons are individual for the whole chat and cannot be repeated, but different chats can have the same emoticons. When using a special command, you can see your emoticons and emoticons of other users (merits in this chat). You can also take any of the medals from other users. It is forbidden to issue medals to yourself and remove them from yourself;). Have fun and test the bot yourself by adding it to your group of friends chat with this tag /Medalkin_bot. To get acquainted with the bot commands in detail, enter the /medalkin command in the chat after adding it.
